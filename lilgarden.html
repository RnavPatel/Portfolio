                   inanimate spaces, and how to design for them?
                   <br> <br>
                   Our research led us to four key values within the nurturing experience:
                   Accountability, Patience, Protection, and Affection. From these, we
                   began designing a gamified experience that provided opportunities for
                   <bold>building connections between “gardeners” and their digital garden. </bold>

                   restart the process.

                   curated. Our intervention was a timer like bucket that would reflect the
                   cumulative growth of your garden in your space. As more time passes, the
                   light slowly fades, until indicating a desperate need to water your plants.

                   many steps for how we can further our initial goal of fostering nurture in the digital.

                   1 – <bold>Time</bold>: What would happen if we gave garden to a person to care for a whole week. What would the outcome be and what opportunities for redesigning the experience would we find?
                   <br><br>
                   2 – <bold>Integrated Product System</bold>: How can we further explore the transition between physical and digital by having more physical cues of the digital garden (e.g custom controller mods).

                   3 –<bold>AR Capabilities</bold>: While we were able to hack the oculus for passthrough, how can we lean more into integrating this garden with an existing indoor space? What if I could grow my plants on walls and different counter tops rather than this floating digital plane?
