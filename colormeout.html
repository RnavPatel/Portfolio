                <h3>One of the best qualities of sketching and doodling as a child is filling up the page, 
                    regardless of craft or finesse. I wanted to emphasize this joyful experience of “drawing 
                    for drawings sake” by creating these mysterious devices that feed off of color and 
                    display it as light. That way, the more you color, the more there is to be perceived 
                    by these “color-scape computers.”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, each of these devices have their own personalities that affect how they 
                    perceive color. One is optimistic and always displays the color under it as bright, 
                    one is grumpy and inverses the color he sees, and the last is greedy and will get angry 
                    if there is no color under him (white/black). Through these devices, viewers can 
                    experience their drawings in new ways.

                    cylinder as this almost ouija board device interaction of pushing these computers around 
                    a drawing. When thinking of scale, I made it two-handed so that people would be immersed with the devices.

                    For the physical computing, I used an Adafruit color sensor, Arduino Uno, 
                    and Adafruit Neopixel. The flow of information worked that color taken from 
                    the color sensor (as RGB wavelengths) would then be mapped via a gamma table 
                    to produce similar color lights in the neopixel strip. Based on this flow of 
                    information, I crafted the device to fit the computing parts and support sensor 
                    functions (e.g the color sensor is isolated and has a 5mm depth difference which 
                    allows it to accurately see the color under it).

                    Because my intended audience is for children, I worked to make the device durable 
                    and easily openable for debugging purposes. This involved working with tolerances 
                    to make the entire device friction fit, so that it could hold its form when in use 
                    and require no glue for any components. The interior structure was 
                    designed to hold the color sensor in place against rapid movement and keep the arduino 
                    board itself stable.

                    After I got my first device, I wanted to playtest it to inform how I should present 
                    this experience. The overall consensus was that the joy from the project was largely
                     dependent on the colors/materials available, and the size of the paper. Having people 
                     color the entire page themselves was too time-consuming and the device lost appeal 
                     after the first use. This needed to be collaborative and have colors ready to 
                     scan/interact with, as well as more devices that had different interactions.
